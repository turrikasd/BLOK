	//   GL_TEXTURE_2D:    The currently bound 2D texture (i.e. the one we just made)
	//               0:    The mipmap level.  0, since we want to update the base level mipmap image (i.e., the image itself,
	//                         not cached smaller copies)
	//         GL_RGBA:    The internal format of the texture.  This is how OpenGL will store the texture internally (kinda)--
	//                         it's essentially the texture's type.
	//      surface->w:    The width of the texture
	//      surface->h:    The height of the texture
	//               0:    The border.  Don't worry about this if you're just starting.
	//          GL_RGB:    The format that the *data* is in--NOT the texture!  Our test image doesn't have an alpha channel,
	//                         so this must be RGB.
	//GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE:    The type the data is in.  In SDL, the data is stored as an array of bytes, with each channel
	//                         getting one byte.  This is fairly typical--it means that the image can store, for each channel,
	//                         any value that fits in one byte (so 0 through 255).  These values are to be interpreted as
	//                         *unsigned* values (since 0x00 should be dark and 0xFF should be bright).
	// surface->pixels:    The actual data.  As above, SDL's array of bytes.

	//Set the minification and magnification filters.  In this case, when the texture is minified (i.e., the texture's pixels (texels) are
	//*smaller* than the screen pixels you're seeing them on, linearly filter them (i.e. blend them together).  This blends four texels for
	//each sample--which is not very much.  Mipmapping can give better results.  Find a texturing tutorial that discusses these issues
	//further.  Conversely, when the texture is magnified (i.e., the texture's texels are *larger* than the screen pixels you're seeing
	//them on), linearly filter them.  Qualitatively, this causes "blown up" (overmagnified) textures to look blurry instead of blocky.
